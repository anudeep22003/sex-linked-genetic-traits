I wrote this program to solidify my understanding of how it was found that genes and genetic traits live on chromosomes. While this is widely understood now, in the early 20th century Thomas Hunt Morgan and Calvin Bridges worked together on fruitflies and after many generations of offsprings noticed a male fruitfly with white eyes as opposed to the red eyes that all the other frutflies had. This was a potential mendelian trait, and even more interestingly in the subsequent to subsequent generation 50% of males had white eyes but all the females had red eyes. This led to a series of explorations that led them to realize the roles chromosomes play in heredity.  

They were very lucky to have landed on a sex linked trait. One that lives on the 23rd chromosome and only on the X chromose and not on the Y chromosome. By following this hunch, they realized and irrefutaby proved that genes exist on chromosomes. This won THomas Hunt Morgan a Nobel Prize in 1933. 

This program is to follow aong computationally the biologic findings, and see why only males in the F2 generation had white eyes and not females. I was also interested in seeing how this number would change in the next generation, and see how many females received both the alleles for white eys.
